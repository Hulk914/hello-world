-> To use ngModel we need to import FormsModule in app.module.ts

-> To create a component firstly import Component. Then we need @Component which has the selector, templates etc.

-> declare the component in AppModule

-> For service use and import @Injectable() decorator before class declaration.

-> where we are using the service add providers in @component and create a constructor . Eg. constructor(private heroService: HeroService) { }

-> For OnInit, import it and class should implement it.
